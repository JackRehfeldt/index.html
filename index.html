</body> At Tri-Tech SC students learn new skills for high school credit.
It's not hard at all to learn this code. It took me only two days to 
create this page! Some credits include: Health and Nutrition, 
Cyber Security, Digital Film Making, etc. Taking these classes is a 
great resume addition. Each class is a half credit and you can take 
these all through high school.</body>
